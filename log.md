# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 80: November 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Fixed some CSS on my cryptoFolio React App from yesterday, thought about adding more functionality such as searching and adding/deleting cryptos. Installed and starting reading about Elixir, documentation. Started [Elixir School](https://elixirschool.com/en/lessons/basics/collections/)

**Thoughts:** I know what I should add to my app, I am struggling with where to place my react logic, will be working on that more. Looking into Elixir seems exciting and starting with basic terms and data types today was a good idea.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

<!-- ### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
