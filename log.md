# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 87: Tuesday, November 20, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Watched CS50 lectures and did problem sets.

**Thoughts**: I checked out a pretty cool React tutorial to build an app with the open weather API, I had previously done one with Node and Express so I figured I try this since it didn't have any React. It was easy to follow and it came out pretty nice. It just isn't responsive.

### Day 86: Monday, November 19, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Watched CS50 lectures and did problem sets.

**Thoughts**: Caught up with lectures on Data Structures and Memory in CS50 course, also tried setting up some problem sets from the first lecture and since it's in C it was a challenge but the basic principals make sense so I somewhat understand what the code means. Still challenging.

### Day 85: Sunday, November 18, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Re-did entire crypto app, more React and reading

**Thoughts**: Completely compelled to make my little crypto better and so I set out to work on something entirely new with a different API and some different styling just to practice more CSS too! SPent the morning watching and reading tutorials and after this I think I want to build a full stack application that is a clone of Blockfolio App. After laundry and gym I came back to set up iTerm2, oh my zsh and Flux on my machine. A cute set up makes me happy to code!

### Day 84: Saturday, November 17, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Thinking in React

**Thoughts**: Went to a mass meditation by The Big Quiet and it was really useful and relaxing, woke up with real intention and motivation outside of coding. Did a ridiculous amount of cleaning, I'd consider it a workout the way I scrubbed my tub.After everything wa clean, I read 'A Book on C' still in the beginning pages but very insightful on programming science. Still felt unsure with React so I started reading this page on the documentation that several have recommended, will continue it tomorrow while planning my application.

### Day 83: Friday, November 16, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Taught @ Code Nation: The Box Model, Elixir and Intern Meeting!

**Thoughts**: Continued lesson on the box model, introducing use of divs to provide layout structure to html pages, along with the spacing and border that makes them look nice and neat. After a quick coffee and sandwich headed to midtown to discuss a potential for a winter internship with a cool company, prospects seem very good. Went back to office to plan how to re-structure my cryptofolio app, mostly reading and breaking down components and what goes where, I'm still not clear on understanding so I will keep reading before trying to code.

### Day 81: Wednesday, November 14, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Pair programming and more Elixir

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with my pair programming session, it was with a lead engineer at startup and besides not being in the mood, I became extremely nervous and had a terrible case of stage fright. I turned back and continued looking at the Elixir documents to understand more basic structures. I also made some CSS changes to my CryptoFolio app but I am still struggling with how to understand where my logic goes especially if I only want to do one API call for both the search and the real-time updates.

### Day 80: Tuesday, November 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Fixed some CSS on my cryptoFolio React App from yesterday, thought about adding more functionality such as searching and adding/deleting cryptos. Installed and starting reading about Elixir, documentation. Started [Elixir School: Basics - Collections](https://elixirschool.com/en/lessons/basics/collections/)

**Thoughts:** I know what I should add to my app, I am struggling with where to place my react logic, will be working on that more. Looking into Elixir seems exciting and starting with basic terms and data types today was a good idea.

<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

<!-- ### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
